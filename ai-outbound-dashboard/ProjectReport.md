## 2. Requirements & Features (PRD Mapping)

### Core Features (from PRD)
- **Upload leads via CSV**  
  **Status:** âœ… Fully implemented. Drag-and-drop CSV upload, validation, preview, and error handling using react-dropzone. **Validation and preview are now handled by the backend for consistency and reliability.**
- **Automatically qualify leads using AI**  
  **Status:** âœ… Fully implemented. Uses Langchain with OpenAI GPT-4 and structured prompts for comprehensive lead qualification, including company research and detailed scoring.
- **Sync qualified leads to HubSpot CRM**  
  **Status:** âœ… Fully implemented. Qualified leads (score â‰¥ 7) are synced to HubSpot CRM using the official API client and your real API key.
- **Monitor real-time campaign analytics**  
  **Status:** âœ… Fully implemented. Analytics dashboard UI, real-time data via WebSocket, and live updates are now fully functional.

### User Stories
- As a user, I can upload a CSV of leads and see validation/preview before submission (now powered by backend validation).
- As a user, I can see each lead automatically qualified and scored with reasoning.

- **Next.js App Router:** All interactive/browser components must be marked with `"use client"`.
- **API Route Structure:** All API endpoints use the `/route.ts` convention for compatibility.
- **Environment Variables:** All API keys are loaded from `.env.local` in the project root.
- **Error Handling:** All endpoints and UI components provide clear error messages for validation and API failures.
- **TypeScript:** All data structures and API payloads are strongly typed.
- **Security:** API keys are never committed to version control.
